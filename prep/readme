Scripts used to preprocess the logs

- Each log has a different format and different parculiarity, 
 so a dedicated script is used to format and prepare the log. 

- The final output file is in json format
{'uid': userid (either exact or proximated, or leave as "U")
 'qid': querid that is unique within a single user, for example, composed of uid + timestamp
 'qtext': query text,
 'urls': [(url1, timestamp, rank), (url2 ..], clicked urls
 'qtype': query type: [new|page|na] whether it's a new query or a pagination, or not known
 'qtime': timestamp of the query
 'qel': entity linking result of the query
}



run.sh: run the scripts to pre-process the logs
run_el.sh: run the script to run fast entity linking

run_wpclicks.sh: run the scripts to compute transition probabilities of WP clicks
