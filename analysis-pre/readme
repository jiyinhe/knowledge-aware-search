Analysis of the logs pre- modelling and predictions
Purpose:
- descriptive stats of data
- sanity check of the hypotheses over user search patterns


Descriptive stats:

1. navigation  - navigational queries are not good for our purpose:
We cannot identify all navigational queries, instead, we only identify those that are
direct url inputs.
-- # and % (non) navigational queries
-- mean, sd over user: # and % non-nav queries 
-- % user: # and % non-nav queries > threshold x

2. entities (threshold -3)
-- % non navigational queries linked with entities  
-- mean, sd over user: % non-nav queries linked with entities 
-- % user: % non-nav queries linked with entities > threshold x

3. change of mind - queries
-- find sequences of queries that share same words but are not identical 

4. change of mind - urls
-- find sequences of queries that are identical but with different clicked results
-- Note: assume that consecutive identical queries are from pagination 

5. change of mind - entities
-- find sequences of queries that share the same linked entity but different intent
