Purpose of analysis:
- check if there is a correlation between the order of entities occuring in user queries and that ooccur in WPclick stream 

Parameter setup:
- threshold of entities in queries: -3
- filter out queries that are not new queries (e.g. pagination)
- filter out the user that issued 200K+ queries (bot)

statsQueryEt.py: 
Examine stats of the entity pairs in query: 
- frequency of the et pair in WPclickstream (if doesn't occur then count 0)
- count of number of users own an et pair 

filterEtPairs.py:
check stats after filtering on:
- number of users own a pair of entities
- whether it occurs in WP

Conclusions:
 - number of users owning a entity pair is not important
